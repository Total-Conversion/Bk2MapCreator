# Bk2MapCreator
Simple Python script for creating Blitzkrieg2 binary map files of any size (so far only square maps are supported)

This script allows to overcome Blitzkrieg2 Editior limitations and create maps larger than 20x20, it should be noted maps larger than 22x22 may suffer from Blitzkrieg2 culling system and not display properly. This can be in part mitigated by changing camera limits, and zooming out more than usually allowed.
